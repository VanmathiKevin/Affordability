# Affordability
Below are the improvements can be done for the project, but unable to accomplish due to time constraints.
1. Logging can be implemented to know the execution flow and find the possible area where the exception occured if any. Unable to provide implementation but added comments wherever possible
2. Global error handling structure through custom middleware is implemented, but to be applied on all possible action methods.
3. Negative unit test cases should be written and data to be mocked and provided to test cases.
